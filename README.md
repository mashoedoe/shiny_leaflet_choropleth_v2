# Shiny Leaflet Choropleth
A choropleth map of South Africa at ward, municipal & provincial level built in R using @RStudio's Shiny, their R package for @Leaflet and system call's to @mbloch's mapshaper to convert source map files from ESRI shapefiles to @mbostock's TopoJSON format.

Static copy of [https://github.com/mashoedoe/shiny_leaflet_choropleth]. R scripts to recreate the GIS data for this app can be sourced there.

Inspired by @jcheng5's [https://jcheng.shinyapps.io/choropleth3] and @jcheng5 & @yihui's [https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/master/inst/examples/shiny.R]
